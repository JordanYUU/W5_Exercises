# W5_Exercises
A collection of exercises and notes from week 5

Kicking off week 5, we begin our journey through Python.
We start with the basics, consisting of print statements, math
calculations via importing, working with data types, and conditional logic.

As such, this week will consist of simple exercises to get us familiar and started.
